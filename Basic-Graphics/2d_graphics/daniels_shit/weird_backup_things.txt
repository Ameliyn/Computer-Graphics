have you checked under /home/ on these computers? There's a folder called "backups" on it:
simpson1-2019-10-01.tgz
simpson1-2019-11-01.tgz
simpson1-2019-12-01.tgz
simpson1-2020-01-01.tgz
simpson1-2020-02-01.tgz
simpson1-2020-03-01.tgz
...
simpson27-2021-10-01.tgz

 Inside this folder are many tarballs, presumably backups. Strangely, they don't seem to be backups of *this* computer. Instead, there are only backups of simpson1 and simpson27. Just those two. I've checked on a couple computers, and this seems to be consistent for all of them.

...
Why are simpson1 and simpson27 backed up an EVERY SINGLE COMPUTER?
